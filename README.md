# Basic-Initiative-Tracker

## About
This is a simple initiative tracker that allows tracking current and total hitpoints as well as initiative for each character. 
The buttons are as follows:
    - **Delete All**: wipes the entire list
    - **Add New**: add a new step to the list
    - **Next**: advance to the next item on the list
    - **Restart**: start over at the beginning of the list
Each initiative item has the following buttons:
    - **Copy**: opens the Add New screen with all fields already filled
    - **Delete**: Deletes that initiative item
